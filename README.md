# MA5761-Statistical-Computing-Final-Project

A Shiny App was created in R to solve examine the following:

Use Monte Carlo simulation to investigate whether the empirical Type I error rate of the t-test is approximately equal to the nominal significance level α, when the sampled population is non-normal. The t-test is robust to mild departures from normality. Discuss the simulation results for the cases where the sampled population is (i) χ2 (1) , (ii) Uniform (0,2), and (iii) Exponential (rate=1). In each case, test H0:μ=μ0 vs. Ha:μ≠μ0 , where μ0 is the mean of χ2 (1) , Uniform(0,2), and Exponential(1), respectively.
